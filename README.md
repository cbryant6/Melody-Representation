# TECHIN 509 Melody Representation

### Tokens as strings are easy to print, compare, and count; no extra structure needed for the basic task.
### A list of melodies keeps dataset boundaries clear; flattening is one line when needed.

```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import chain
from typing import List, Tuple

# A melody is an ordered list of note tokens like c4, D4..etc
Melody = List[str]

def flatten(corpus: List[Melody]) -> List[str]:
    """Combine several melodies (lists) into one long ordered list."""
    return list(chain.from_iterable(corpus))

def ngrams(seq: List[str], n: int = 2) -> List[Tuple[str, ...]]:
    """Adjacent note n-grams; default is bigrams (transitions)."""
    return [tuple(seq[i:i+n]) for i in range(len(seq) - n + 1)]

def analyze(corpus: List[Melody]) -> dict:
    """Basic features you might 'teach' a simple model."""
    all_notes = flatten(corpus)
    return {
        "pitch_vocab": sorted(set(all_notes)),
        "note_counts": Counter(all_notes),
        "bigrams": Counter(ngrams(all_notes, 2)),
        "trigrams": Counter(ngrams(all_notes, 3)),
        "length_total": len(all_notes),
        "num_melodies": len(corpus),
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example sequences C D E...etc
    m1: Melody = ["C4","D4","E4","F4","G4"]
    m2: Melody = ["G4","A4","G4","E4"]
    corpus = [m1, m2]

    stats = analyze(corpus)
    for k, v in stats.items():
        print(k, "->", v)



i. If a melody is like a sentence, what would each word be?
-a word is a single note token (C4, D4...etc) Each token is one position in the musical sentence.

ii. Which Python type keeps items in order?
- a list is best here as it keeps items in order and you can index through it 

iii. How to group several melodies together?
- use a list of lists


Given a set of melodies to teach/train: data storage preference?
List of lists

i. If I have a collection of my chosen data type, how can I flatten them into one?
- List comprehension; itertools.chain

ii. Can I start with an empty list and then add notes from each melody?
- Yes

iii. What tool do I know that combines lists?
List concatenation; (+), .extend(), and itertools.chain.from_iterable.

Suppose you are given a set of melodies, what information would you like to extract to "teach/train" your music composer?
- Intervals, Pitch, Range,
